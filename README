= Description
	A class for monitoring events related to files and directories.  This
	package is deprecated in favor of win32-changejournal on NTFS filesystems.

= Prerequisites
   * Ruby 1.8.0 or later
   * win32-ipc 0.4.0 or later

= Installation
   rake test (optional)
   rake install (non-gem) OR rake install_gem (gem)

= Synopsis
   require 'win32/changenotify'
   include Win32
	
   # Indefinitely wait for a change in 'C:\some\path' and any of its
   # subdirectories.  Print the file and action affected.
	
   filter = ChangeNotify::FILE_NAME | ChangeNotify::DIR_NAME
   path   = 'C:\some\path'
   
   cn = ChangeNotify.new(path, true, filter)

   cn.wait{ |arr|
      arr.each{ |info|
         p info.file_name
         p info.action
      }
   }
   
   cn.close
   
   # OR
   
   ChangeNotify.new(path, true, filter) do |events|
   	events.each{ |event|
   		p event.file_name
   		p event.action
   	}
   end

= Notes
   The Win32::ChangeNotify class is a subclass of Win32::Ipc, and thus has
   all of its methods available as well.
	
   This library is deprecated in favor of win32-changejournal on NTFS
   filesystems.
   
= Pure Ruby vs C Extension
	The C code we used for this library prior to 0.5.0 is still available in
	CVS for this project, but is not distributed with official releases. Note
	that it does NOT contain the completion port approach we use in 0.5.0 and
	later and is actually less reliable (in terms of how many simultaneous
	events it can pickup) as a result.
	
= Known Issues
   Despite the improvements yielded as a result of using completion ports,
   it's still possible that events could be missed. To be more precise,
   any events that occur in the fraction of a second between the call to
   GetQueuedCompletionStatus() and ReadDirectoryChangesW() in the wait loop
   will not get picked up. As a general rule, the faster your system is,
   the less likely you are to encounter this scenario.
   
   We do not believe it is possible to resolve this issue without native
   thread support. We are, however, open to suggestions. :)

= Acknowledgements
   This class was originally based on the Win32::ChangeNotify Perl module by
   Christopher Madsen.
	
= Future Plans
   Probably none. This library is deprecated in favor of win32-changejournal.
   However, that library only works on NTFS filesystems, so this library will
   be maintained as well.
   
   That being said, I'm always open to improvements, so feel free to submit
   ideas and patches.
