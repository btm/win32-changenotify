= Description
  A class for monitoring events related to files and directories.  This
  package is deprecated in favor of win32-changejournal on NTFS filesystems.

= Prerequisites
  * ffi
  * win32-ipc
  * win32-event

= Installation
  gem install win32-changenotify

= Synopsis
  require 'win32/changenotify'
  include Win32
  
  # Indefinitely wait for a change in 'C:\some\path' and any of its
  # subdirectories.  Print the file and action affected.
  
  filter = ChangeNotify::FILE_NAME | ChangeNotify::DIR_NAME
  path   = 'C:\some\path'
   
  cn = ChangeNotify.new(path, true, filter)

  cn.wait{ |arr|
    arr.each{ |info|
      p info.file_name
      p info.action
    }
  }
   
  cn.close
   
  # OR
   
  ChangeNotify.new(path, true, filter) do |events|
    events.each{ |event|
      p event.file_name
      p event.action
    }
  end

= Notes
  The Win32::ChangeNotify class is a subclass of Win32::Ipc, and thus has
  all of its methods available as well.
  
  This library is deprecated in favor of win32-changejournal on NTFS
  filesystems.
   
= Known Issues
  Despite the improvements yielded as a result of using completion ports,
  it's still possible that events could be missed. To be more precise,
  any events that occur in the fraction of a second between the call to
  GetQueuedCompletionStatus() and ReadDirectoryChangesW() in the wait loop
  will not get picked up. As a general rule, the faster your system is,
  the less likely you are to encounter this scenario.
   
  With Ruby 2.x and JRuby this should be even less of an issue than it's
  been in the past.

= Acknowledgements
  This class was originally based on the Win32::ChangeNotify Perl module by
  Christopher Madsen.
  
= Future Plans
  Probably none. This library is deprecated in favor of win32-changejournal.
  However, that library only works on NTFS filesystems, so this library will
  be maintained as well.
   
  That being said, I'm always open to improvements, so feel free to submit
  ideas and patches.
