== 0.5.1 - 21-Aug-2009
* License changed to Artistic 2.0.
* The ChangeNotify#wait method is now slightly more robust.
* Renamed test file to test_win32_changenotify.rb.
* Some gemspec updates, including license and description.
* Renamed example file to example_win32_changenotify.rb to avoid any
  confusion with actual test files.
* Removed the doc/changenotify.txt file because I felt it was redundant.
* Added an example rake task.

== 0.5.0 - 9-Aug-2007
* Now pure Ruby!
* Now requires the win32-event library.
* The constructor now accepts a block. If provided, it yields itself
  and automatically closes itself when the block terminates.
* Removed the ChangeNotify#reset method. It was never especially useful,
  and now it's useless because of the way we wait for events (see below).
* Added a Rakefile with tasks for installation and testing.
* The code now uses completion ports internally, which greatly improves the
  number of simultaneous events it can detect and report. See the 'Known
  Issues' in the README for details on potential misses, however.
* Some internal reorganization, with the C related code now moved into a
  separate directory.
* Doc, test, and example program updates.

== 0.4.2 - 22-Nov-2006
* Fixed bugs caused by changes to the Ruby internals with regards to question
  marks and instance variables.  Thanks go to an anonymous user for the spot.
* Minor documentation updates.

== 0.4.1 - 2-Jan-2006
* Code cleanup

== 0.4.0 - 20-Apr-2005
* ChangeNotify#wait now returns an array of ChangeNotifyStruct's, rather than
  a single struct, because multiple notifications can occur for a single
  event.
* Example program and test suite updates.
* Removed the changenotify.rd file.

== 0.3.1 - 4-Feb-2005
* Fixed a bug in ChangeNotify#wait where the timeout was not set to the
  proper default if a timeout was not specified by the user.  Thanks go
  to CT for the spot.
* Made this document rdoc friendly.
* Corrected the release date for 0.3.0.

== 0.3.0 - 25-Jan-2005
* The ChangeNotify#wait method now yields a ChangeNotifyStruct if a block is
  provided.  This struct contains more detail on what changes occurred.
* Added the ChangeNotify#path, ChangeNotify#recursive? and ChangeNotify#filter
  methods.
* The ChangeNotify.new method no longer accepts a block.  See the developer's
  notes if you want the nitty gritty details.
* Added more code to the extconf.rb file.  This was needed to set the
  _WIN32_WINNT macro properly.
* Moved the 'examples' directory to the toplevel.
* Test suite and documentation updates.

== 0.2.0 - 17-Jul-2004
* Now uses the newer allocation framework.  This means that, as of this
  releas, this package requires Ruby 1.8.0 or later.
* Moved the test.rb file to doc/examples.

== 0.1.0 - 7-May-2004
* Initial release
